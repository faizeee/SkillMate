# ✅ Day 15 Progress – SkillMate 🧠🚀

## 🔹 🐳 Docker Integration (Frontend + Backend)

- ✅ Created a `client/Dockerfile` using **Nginx** to serve Vite build output.
- ✅ Updated `docker-compose.yml`:
  - Connected frontend and backend containers via service names.
  - Mapped ports:
    - Frontend: `3000:80`
    - Backend: `8000:8000`
- ✅ Frontend running at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- ✅ Backend API docs at: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- ✅ Verified JWT Auth flow is functional with PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ 🔧 Docker Line Ending Fix (Windows Shell Script Issue)

We resolved a blocking Docker bug caused by **Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`)** in shell scripts.

### 🔸 Problem:
- Docker container failed with:  
  `exec ./start.sh: no such file or directory`  
  despite `start.sh` being present.

### 🔸 Root Cause:
- File had Windows-style CRLF endings, making `chmod +x` ineffective inside Linux container.

### ✅ Solution:
- Replaced `dos2unix` (which wasn't available) with:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN sed -i 's/\r$//' ./start.sh

    Followed by:

    RUN chmod +x ./start.sh
    CMD ["./start.sh"]

✅ Outcome:

    Docker container now builds & starts reliably.

    start.sh executes correctly inside the container.

    Portable and robust for future dev/prod builds.

🔹 ✅ GitHub Actions CI Setup
✅ Backend CI (.github/workflows/backend.yml)

    Setup Python with actions/setup-python

    Installed dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt

    Injected .env for tests dynamically:

    database_url=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test_db
    secret_key=test_secret

    Added PostgreSQL service in CI with health checks

    Ran pytest --cov=. and uploaded coverage to Codecov

✅ Frontend CI (.github/workflows/frontend.yml)

    Setup Node.js with actions/setup-node

    Installed dependencies with npm ci

    Ran npm run test:coverage

    Uploaded coverage to Codecov

🔹 ✅ Environment Handling in CI

    Used .env locally for backend/frontend dev/test configs.

    Injected CI-specific values using env: and inline echo to .env:

    run: |
      echo "database_url=..." > backend/.env
      echo "secret_key=test_secret" >> backend/.env
