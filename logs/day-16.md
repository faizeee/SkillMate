# ✅ Day 16 – Persistent CI + Pre-commit Setup Done

Today was all about stability, cleanup, and full-stack sanity. After intense Redis debugging, we’ve locked in a smooth, tested, and production-friendly development workflow.

---

## ✅ What’s Working Now

### 🐳 Dockerized Environment
- PostgreSQL runs in a container (`skillmate-db-1`)
- FastAPI backend and React frontend fully containerized
- `start.sh` reliably seeds the database once (via `touch /app/.seeded`)
- Windows line endings issue resolved using:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN sed -i 's/\r$//' ./start.sh

### 📦 Poetry-Based Dependency Management

    Switched from requirements.txt to Poetry for clean dependency resolution

    Resolved compatibility issues (fastapi-cache2 required < Python 4.0)

    Docker uses:

    COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock* ./
    RUN poetry install --no-root

### ✅ Pre-commit Hooks (Linting + Formatting)

    Set up and working locally:

        black

        flake8 (with custom .flake8 config for test exclusions)

        check-yaml, check-json

        trim-trailing-whitespace, fix-end-of-files

    Installed via:

    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run --all-files

### 🔄 GitHub Actions CI

    Runs tests on every push and PR to main

    PostgreSQL service added to CI pipeline

    Caches pip/npm dependencies

    Coverage uploaded to Codecov:

        backend (Pytest + SQLite/PostgreSQL)

        frontend (Vitest + Vite)

### services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    env:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: test_db
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

### ❌ Redis Removed (for now)

After 2 days of integration attempts:

    CI was failing to initialize async Redis properly in tests

    Local and Docker worked, but not predictably

    We decided to drop Redis for now to focus on more critical features

    Redis logic is cleanly removed, but code comments and lessons are kept for future

### 🛡️ Main Branch Protection Tip

Enable these settings on GitHub:

    Go to your repo → Settings > Branches

    Add a branch protection rule for main

    Enable:

        ✅ Require pull request reviews

        ✅ Require status checks to pass (CI)

        ✅ Include administrators

### 🧪 Final Test Summary (Today)

✅ All tests pass
✅ Coverage uploaded
✅ CI + pre-commit = solid
✅ Docker clean + reproducible
✅ Redis removed (clean exit)
